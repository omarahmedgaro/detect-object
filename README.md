The provided code implements a Streamlit application for object detection using a pre-trained model. Here's a breakdown of the code and its functionalities:

Imports:

streamlit as st: Imports the Streamlit library for creating web applications.
cv2: Imports OpenCV library for computer vision tasks.
numpy as np: Imports NumPy for numerical operations.
Application Title and Image Upload:

st.title("My First Streamlit Application"): Sets the title of the application.
st.write("Please Upload Your Image"): Displays a message prompting users to upload an image.
uploaded_image = st.file_uploader("choose an Image..", type = ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png']): Creates a file uploader widget allowing users to select images with specific formats (jpg, jpeg, png).
Object Detection Model Setup (Outside the upload conditional block):

These lines define the configuration file path (config_file), frozen model path (frozen_model), and class label file path (file_name).
The code then:
Creates a cv2.dnn_DetectionModel object (model) using the specified configuration and frozen model.
Sets the input size for the model (model.setInputSize(320,320))
Defines various parameters for normalization and pre-processing (model.setInputScale, model.setInputMean, model.setInputSwapRB)
Reads class labels from the text file (class_labels)
Image Processing and Detection (Inside the upload conditional block):

if uploaded_image is not None:: This block executes only if an image is uploaded.
The uploaded image is converted to a NumPy array (image = np.array(bytearray(uploaded_image.read()), dtype = np.uint8))
The image is decoded using OpenCV (img = cv2.imdecode(image, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR))
The original image is displayed using Streamlit (st.image(uploaded_image, caption = 'BGR Image.', channels = 'BGR'))
Object detection is performed using the model.detect function:
ClassIndex, confidence, bbox: These variables store the predicted class indices, confidence scores, and bounding boxes for detected objects.
A loop iterates through the detected objects:
Bounding boxes are drawn around the objects (cv2.rectangle)
Class labels are displayed on top of the bounding boxes (cv2.putText)
The processed image with bounding boxes and labels is converted to RGB format (imd=cv2.cvtColor(img,cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)) and displayed using Streamlit (st.image(imd, caption = 'detect objects', channels = 'RGB'))
